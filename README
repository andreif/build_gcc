This is so I can save my gnu cross compiler build scripts for various targets.  This is how I build the compilers I am using for the other
examples.  Also a clang/llvm script as well.  Only need one build of clang/llvm for all targets

these scripts were derived from a script found in the mpx project at opencores.org.
